Pointbreak integrates with VS Code and compatible editors through an extension. This page documents available settings and commands.

## Extension Overview

**Extension ID:** `pointbreak.pointbreak`

**Publisher:** Pointbreak

**Install from:**
- [VS Code Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=pointbreak.pointbreak)
- Extensions panel in VS Code (search "Pointbreak")

## Extension Settings

Currently, Pointbreak has minimal settings. The extension is designed to work out of the box with sensible defaults.

### Auto-Start MCP Server

**Setting:** `pointbreak.autoStartMcpServer`

**Default:** `true`

**Description:** Automatically start the MCP server when VS Code opens.

```json
{
  "pointbreak.autoStartMcpServer": true
}
```

Set to `false` if you want to manage the MCP server lifecycle manually.

### MCP Server Port

**Setting:** `pointbreak.mcpServerPort`

**Default:** `auto` (automatically assigned)

**Description:** WebSocket port for MCP server communication. Usually doesn't need to be changed.

```json
{
  "pointbreak.mcpServerPort": "auto"
}
```

Set to a specific port number if you encounter conflicts:

```json
{
  "pointbreak.mcpServerPort": 9876
}
```

## Commands

Access commands via Command Palette (Cmd/Ctrl+Shift+P).

### Show Binary Info

**Command:** `Pointbreak: Show Binary Info`

**Description:** Display information about the installed Pointbreak MCP server binary.

Shows:
- Binary path
- Version number
- Platform and architecture
- Installation date
- File size

**Use when:**
- Verifying Pointbreak is installed correctly
- Troubleshooting installation issues
- Checking which version is active

## Status Bar

Pointbreak shows its status in the VS Code status bar (bottom of window).

**Status indicators:**

- **🌊 Pointbreak** (green) - MCP server running and connected
- **🌊 Pointbreak** (orange) - MCP server starting
- **🌊 Pointbreak** (red) - MCP server failed or disconnected

Click the status bar item to:
- View MCP server logs
- Restart the MCP server
- Show binary info

## Output Panel

View detailed logs in the Output panel:

1. **Open Output panel:**
   - View → Output
   - Or: Cmd/Ctrl+Shift+U

2. **Select Pointbreak logs:**
   - Dropdown: "Pointbreak MCP Server"

**Logs include:**
- MCP server startup messages
- Connection events
- Debug session lifecycle
- Error messages
- Performance metrics

## Debugger Integration

Pointbreak automatically integrates with your IDE's debugger. No additional configuration required.

**Supported debug adapters:**

Works with any Debug Adapter Protocol (DAP) compliant debugger:

- **Python** - debugpy (via Python extension)
- **JavaScript/TypeScript** - Node Debug (built-in)
- **Rust, C, C++** - CodeLLDB
- **Go** - Delve (via Go extension)
- And more...

**Breakpoint synchronization:**

Breakpoints set by AI assistants appear in your IDE:
- Red dots in gutter
- Listed in Breakpoints panel
- Can be toggled/modified manually

**Debug console:**

Debug console output is captured and made available to AI assistants for inspection.

## Workspace Settings

Pointbreak respects workspace-specific settings. Create `.vscode/settings.json` in your project:

```json
{
  "pointbreak.autoStartMcpServer": false
}
```

This overrides global settings for that workspace only.

## Extension Updates

Pointbreak auto-updates through VS Code's extension update mechanism.

**Check for updates:**

1. Extensions panel
2. Click gear icon next to Pointbreak
3. Select "Check for Updates"

**Or:**

View → Extensions → Pointbreak → Update button (if available)

## Compatibility

Requires VS Code 1.74.0 or later.

**Compatible editors:**

- VS Code ✅
- Cursor ✅
- Windsurf ✅
- VS Codium ✅
- Other VS Code-compatible editors with extension support ✅

**Operating systems:**

## Uninstallation

## Troubleshooting

### Extension Not Working

**Check extension is enabled:**

1. Extensions panel
2. Search "Pointbreak"
3. Verify it's installed and enabled (not disabled)

**Restart VS Code:**

Sometimes extensions need a restart to activate properly.

**Check Output panel:**

View → Output → "Pointbreak MCP Server"

Look for error messages or connection issues.

### MCP Server Won't Start

**Verify binary is installed:**

Run `Pointbreak: Show Binary Info` command.

If binary is missing, reinstall:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://withpointbreak.com/install.sh | sh
```

**Check file permissions (Linux/macOS):**

```bash
chmod +x ~/.local/bin/pointbreak
```

**Disable antivirus temporarily (Windows):**

Windows Defender may block the binary on first run.

### AI Assistant Can't Find Pointbreak

**For GitHub Copilot / Cursor:**

No additional configuration needed. Restart VS Code and try again.

**For external AI assistants (Claude Code, Codex, etc.):**

1. Verify MCP server is installed: `pointbreak --version`
2. Check AI assistant's MCP configuration points to correct binary path
3. Restart AI assistant

See [AI Assistants Guide](/ai-assistants) for detailed setup.
