**AI assistants can write code. Now they can debug it too.**

Give your AI assistant real debugger access to set breakpoints, step through code, and inspect variables in your IDE—all through natural language.

## Why Pointbreak?

Instead of adding print statements or guessing what's wrong, your AI assistant can:

- **Set breakpoints** - "Break on line 42 in main.py"
- **Inspect variables** - "Show me the value of user_input"
- **Step through code** - "Step into this function"
- **Find bugs faster** - Run and examine code in real-time

Pointbreak uses your IDE's existing debugger, so you get all your installed debug adapters, breakpoint UI, and variable inspection—but now controllable through AI.
